# App-Extensions

App extensions and helpers that can be used in any app. App extensions can connect to the store, dispatch actions and
run sagas. They also use tocco-ui for the visual parts.

## actionEmitter

With actionEmitter it is possible to dispatch actions in the store of a parent app.
For example logging-actions or errors that can't be handled by a package itself.

## actions

Can render action buttons and runs action executions.

Import:

```javascript
import { actions } from "tocco-app-extensions";
```

Initialization:

```javascript
actions.addToStore(store, { formApp, listApp, customActions });
```

config, the second parameter, is an object that can have the following properties:

- formApp: Simple form App, is needed to render simple Action settings.
- listApp: Entity-List App, is needed to render remote fields in action settings.
- customActions: An object with App specific custom actions. The key is the id of the custom action as defined
  in the form.

Render an action:

```javascript
<actions.Action definition={actionDefinition} selection={selection} />
```

## appFactory

Helper methods to create a react/redux/saga app.

## errorLogging

An abstraction to handle errors with multiple handlers such as remote logging.

See the corresponding story for more details.

## externalEvents

Can be added to the store to call external events/callback from anywhere with an action.

## field

Helper to create a data field. Depending on the mapping a type as editable or readonly value.

## form

Utils for redux forms (`redux-form`).

## formData

Helps connect fields with logic and data such as relation entities from remote and select fields.

Import:

```javascript
import { formData } from "tocco-app-extensions";
```

Initialization:

```javascript
formData.addToStore(store, { listApp, navigationStrategy });
```

config, the second parameter, is an object an can have the following properties:

- listApp: Entity-List App component. Is used to connect the remote field with a list search.
- navigationStrategy: See tocco-util > navigationStrategy for more information

## formField

Helper to create tocco-ui FormField component with a label and a field.

## keyDown

Exports a <keyDown.KeyDownWatcher> component that can wrap an application. The component registers a key down event
and a global key down event on document.

A list of shortcuts can be registered containing a list of actions that will be triggered if the key is pressed and
the modifiers match.

```javascript
keyDown.addToStore(store, {
  ctrl: true,
  alt: true,
  code: "KeyM",
  actions: [
    toggleShortcutMenu("modules"),
  ],
  global: true,
});
```

## notification

Allows to dispatch actions to show a toaster or confirm dialog. Just needs to be added to the store and then one of
the exported actions can be dispatched anywhere. When added to store, it can be configured if those actions are
handled or if they get emitted.

See the corresponding story for more details.

## remote events

Remote event action are primarily dispatched by actions after execution.
This util provides the action creator and action definition.

## rest

TOCCO REST Api abstraction. Helps compose url, set headers, order params with proper error handling.
